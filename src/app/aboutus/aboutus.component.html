      <p>Our ongoing programmes:</p><br>
      <h4>Smart Agri</h4>
      <p>Agriculture is becoming more and more knowledge intensive. Millions of food-insecure smallholder farmers in India could improve their yields, incomes and resilience if they had access to the appropriate information and knowledge to make informed choices about their farms. Acknowledging these issues the project was conceptualised to addresses these challenges related with the agriculture by bringing in use of technology to improve the agriculture productivity and socio-economic condition of the farmers.
      The project aims to deliver a comprehensive solution on smart agriculture using tech-based approach to improve agriculture practices, farm yield, revenues and overall quality of life for farmers. It also aims to enhance livelihoods of around 50,000 small farmers (cotton, soya) through sustainable farming approaches and improve agriculture practices by adopting IOT based solutions through Sensors, Multilingual Application, QueryBot, Crop Disease Detection, Artificial Intelligence for data analysis. Regular training and handhold support are being provided to the farmers for adoption of tech based farming methods to increase the productivity. It also build entrepreneurs in the form of lead farmers who support a cluster of farmers through tech-enabled 100 demonstrations farm land. The initiative is for two years and is under implementation in Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra.</p><br><br>
      <h4>Jigyasa</h4>
      <p>Our flagship programme in the domain of Education – Jigyasa – aims to be build knowledge for life and addresses some of the most pressing concerns faced by education sector in India. It is widely known that most teachers follow traditional method of teaching which makes classrooms uninteresting and causes drop outs amongst students. Often infrastructure provided by the government is also not adequately used enough. Our intervention aims to build capacity of teachers, introduce digital content to make learning and teaching more enjoyable, and augment existing infrastructure as needed.
      By introduction of digital training tools, content and innovative pedagogy, Jigyasa has helped more than 12,000 teachers, over 2 lakh students in 26 districts across five states within a year of its operations.  Jigyasa also addresses another pressing concern of the education sector – limited awareness and access to scholarships. We have also developed India’s largest multi-lingual scholarship discovery and assistance platform – www.learningwithvodafoneidea.inwhich curates information of scholarships worth more than Rs. 15,000 crore rupees. Almost 30,000 students have received scholarship – several of them for the first time – through support provided by our scholarship portal.</p>
